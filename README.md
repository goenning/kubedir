# Kubedir is a directory for all things Kubernetes.

Visit https://kubedir.com to see it live.

The goal of this site is to become a guide for those searching for tooling around Kubernetes.
It's not a simple list of tools, it's a comprehensive list of features and comparison between all different options.

### What's next?

- Add "Features" to each alternative
- Add option to compare different alternatives
- Add a global "Search" functionality
- Add stats to each alternative:
  - User submitted review (sign in via GitHub)
  - Like count (sign in not required)
  - GitHub stars for open source projects
  - Helm chart downloads/stars for Helm charts
  - Project Health (based on GitHub stats like last release date, number of contributors, commit frequency, open issues)
- Expand to new topics
- Dark Mode
